# Head over to https://github.com/CubeCoders/AMPTranslations for general information inside README.md

# Welcome
I set up an instance of Weblate to take care of the translations. You can find it here (https://weblate.bromunity.de/projects/amp-translations/github/)

The file 'en.json' inside this repo serves as base file for translations. If you're missing some strings, create a pull request to this repo. Please use Translation Mode(more info at cubecoders repo) to add strings.

If you encounter any problems or have any wishes, create an issue here :)
